Recommendation systems support users in obtaining information on the Internet by suggesting content based on their interests.
However, the users are trapped in their filter bubble and only receive content that matches their interests.
The goal is to develop an alternative navigation system that encourages users to engage with different content and break through their personal filter bubble.
The focus is on a representation of information with the help of formal concept analysis, which differs from conventional list representations on the Internet.
To investigate the impact of the system, a qualitative study was conducted with 10 participants.
The results show that the participants are stimulated by the system to deal with diverse content.
